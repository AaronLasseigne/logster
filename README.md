## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'logster', github: 'SamSaffron/logster'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

## Usage

Logster is in current development, at the moment the focus is on a decent tool for dev. Once that is complete production mode will be build.

The concept is to have an embedded "exception reporting service" admins can view on live sites.
